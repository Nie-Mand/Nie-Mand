> Java, Php and Angular are the consequences of bad taste and irresponsibility, me  



- React is the only act
- Typescript, it do not slip
- Node the woo, in Typescript too
- TailwindCSS is the frontend's princess
- Next is a way to flex
- Remix.run is a reason to have fun 
- Go is good to go
- Rust is a must
- Web3 is not boring but his people are annoyin
- to DevOps I'm getting attached, cz it make's me way more cash
- Php got high rank, yet no thanks 
- Java, I won't touch that shit ever
- Angular is fine, and it sucks, and it doesn't rhyme 
- Vue looks elegant, but its not in the market yet
- Docker, the day , about it I was told, Kubernetes dropped their support
- 5 lines in python, if it's more, need a refactor


## Have I made something cool?
I have `claas` for now, the other ones are private
